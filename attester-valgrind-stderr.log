==88== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==88== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==88== or are doing some strange experiment):
==88==   /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=88 ...command...
==88== 
==88== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==88==   /path/to/gdb bin/attester
==88== and then give GDB the following command
==88==   target remote | /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=88
==88== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
