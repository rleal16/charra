# Remote Attestation component of the Arcadian-IoT (RA2IOT)

This repository hosts the development of a Remote Attestation system carried out in the scope of the ARCADIAN-IoT - Autonomous Trust, Security and Privacy Management Framework for IoT, Grant Agreement Number:101020259. H2020-SU-DS02-2020.

This work is adapted from the [CHARRA: CHAllenge-Response based Remote Attestation with TPM 2.0](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-SIT/charra) project, whose goal is to implement a (hybrid) Remote Attestation system for IoT devices, without relying .
In particular, the majority of the code present in the files in the folders "src/common/" and "src/util/" is the same as the one from CHARRA's, as well as the Makefile's. Furthermore, references to the original code and authors are stated in each file of these folders.

However, to keep the code consistent, and within the context of the ARCADIAN-IoT, every "CHARRA" and "charra" prefix was substituted by to "RA2IOT" and "ra2iot", respectively.
