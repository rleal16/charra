# Remote Attestation

This repository hosts the development of a Remote Attestation system carried out in the scope of the ARCADIAN-IoT - Autonomous Trust, Security and Privacy Management Framework for IoT, Grant Agreement Number:101020259. H2020-SU-DS02-2020.

This work is adapted from the [CHARRA: CHAllenge-Response based Remote Attestation with TPM 2.0](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-SIT/charra) project, where the goal is to implement a (hybrid) Remote Attestation system for IoT devices, without TPMs.
